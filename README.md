### What I do
I am currently at the [Department of Agricultural Biology](https://agsci.colostate.edu/agbio/), Colorado State University, Fort Collins, as a PhD student in [the Leach lab](https://agsci.colostate.edu/leachlab/). 
I am currently studying transcriptional regulation of defense response genes in rice.
